	Story:
		Act One: Exile
			- Small text-and-image intro screen.
			- Tutorial mission - pirate hunting
			- Alien fleet invades.
			- Human coalition attacks aliens in massive strike.
			- Player is ordered to attack alien forces in orbit
			- Player's strike force is decimated
			- Unknown entity contacts player, and temporarily confuses enemy communications to allow player to escape.
			- Unknown entity guides player to human Ark-Mothership. Player can rescue units along the way.
			- Human attack fails.
			- It is then revealed to player that he/she is the unknown entity, the AI controlling the Ark-Mothership.
			- Player then uses the Ark-Mothership to do an emergency jump to parts unknown.
		Act Two: Contact
			- Ark-Mothership jumps to an empty star system.
			- Tutorial for personnel and resource gathering. Note that the tutorials are masked as the Ark's systems coming online.
			- Tutorial for ship-building. (Note that this time, player receives strange energy readings - they turn out to be cloaked observer ships to be revealed later on).
			- Tutorial for base-building.
			- Tutorial for travelling between star-systems.
			- Player receives unknown alien signal in a new star system. This is revealed to be an ancient stargate.
			- Player activates stargate, and enemy alien forces stream through.
			- Player undertakes multiple missions to stop enemies and defend home territory. (Sidequests)
			- Player defeats forces, but large enemy reinforcements arrive.
			- Friendly aliens decloak and help the player.
			- Friendly aliens then conduct diplomacy with player.
			- Aliens advise player of the political landscape. Player then learns about possible allies, neutral parties, and enemies. Player also learns about the Empire, the race that attacked Earth.
			- Player then starts mission to gain allies and free Earth. 
			- Player moves Ark through the Stargate and into the greater galactic sector.
		Act Three: Freedom

			- Player defeats and frees Earth in a series of battles. (Sidequests and multiple main quests)
			- Boss battle: Archenemy
			- Player defeats archenemy, but PLOT TWIST archenemy is only protecting the rest of galactic civilization.
			- Player learns of the Great Filters - a massive fleet of very strong ships, commanded by godlike beings who live in the galactic core.
			- It is then revealed that the player is not an actual AI, but a human merged with an artificial intelligence, cyberized and preserved in the Ark-Mothership, 
				and the existence of the Player is the reason for the Invasion - that the Great Filters will undertake a Purge, wiping all life in the galaxy via gamma-ray-burst if a threat to their 
				'godhood' is detected. It is then surmised that the Path to 'godhood' starts via cyberization and expansion of the gestalt through melding with artificial intelligence 
				(which the Player has done). In-game fluff-reference to the player leveling up was the player moving up the Path.
			- Arch enemy dies, and commands player to stop the Purge.
		Act Four: Ascension

			- Player gathers resources, allies, and intelligence, again. (Sidequests)

			- Allies arrive. Player undertakes several missions to assist allies (Sidequests)
			- Player and allies must then push to the core under heavy resistance (Sidequests)

			- Boss battle: Core Gods Alpha and Omega, and a reanimated Guardian of the Core.
			- Boss battle: Ultimate intelligence: The One (Core Gods + Guardian)
			- As the Player defeats the Ultimate Intelligence, it charges the entirety of life in the galaxy to fight against the encroaching Heat-death.
			  This comes at the cost of the Ark being destroyed.
		Epilogue
			- Photo montage of the results of the Player's actions.
			- Photo montage of the Player going to other galaxies in a new Ark, through the Stargate.
			- Gameplay starts, mirroring the start of Act One, but with a different ship and different character.

			- It is then explained that in the far future, the life in the universe banded together to create the Heaven's Door, 
			  a Kerr Metric naked singularity that leads to an infinity of multiverses, thereby defeating Entropy.
