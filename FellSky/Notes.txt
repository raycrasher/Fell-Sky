			- Tutorial for travelling between star-systems.
			- Player receives unknown alien signal in a new star system. This is revealed to be an ancient stargate.
			- Player activates stargate, and enemy alien forces stream through.

			- Player defeats forces, but large enemy reinforcements arrive.

			- Player learns of the Great Filters - a massive fleet of very strong ships, commanded by godlike beings who live in the galactic core.
			- It is then revealed that the player is not an actual AI, but a human merged with an artificial intelligence, cyberized and preserved in the Ark-Mothership, 
				and the existence of the Player is the reason for the Invasion - that the Great Filters will undertake a Purge, wiping all life in the galaxy via gamma-ray-burst if a threat to their 
				'godhood' is detected. It is then surmised that the Path to 'godhood' starts via cyberization and expansion of the gestalt through melding with artificial intelligence 
				(which the Player has done). In-game fluff-reference to the player leveling up was the player moving up the Path.

			- Boss battle: Ultimate intelligence: The One (Core Gods + Guardian)
